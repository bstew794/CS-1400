Assn 13 - task 3

    My hope is to create a program that draws a list of shapes that have been stored as objects defined by specific
        classes according to a user input. The program must also display a menu each time that provide the option of
        adding/removing objects from the list as well as drawing them, and a exit option to terminate the program.
        All shapes must be in the same list, and the shapes may only be certain colors that are also defined in a list.

Design:

    Circle.py will begin by importing turtle

    The Circle class will be defined:

        the centerX, centerY, etc. variables will be stored as private variables in the initializer

        the draw() function will be defined:

             a circle according to the given variables will be drawn


    Rectangle.py will begin by importing turtle

    The Rectangle class will be defined:

        the centerX, centerY, etc. variables will be stored as private variables in the initializer

        the draw() function will be defined:

            a rectangle according to the given variables will be drawn


    assn13-task3.py will begin by importing Circle from circle.py, and Rectangle from rectangle.py and turtle will be
        imported

    isColorValid() will be defined to check if user color matches the list of [red, green, blue, yellow]

    main() will be defined:

        a while loop will start:

            a menu will be displayed for the user to see

            the program will ask for user input

            if "Enter Circle":

                asks for dimensions from user

                adds a circle of class Circle to the object list with user input

            if "Enter Rectangle":

                asks for dimensions from user

                adds a rectangle of class Rectangle to the object list with user input

            if "Remove shape"

                displays list and asks for user input

                removes chosen object from list

            if "Draw shape":

                draws all objects in the list in order

            if "Exit":

                exits while loop and ends function

    main() will be invoked

    End of line...
