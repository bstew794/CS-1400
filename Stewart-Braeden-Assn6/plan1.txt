Assn-6: Task 1

To complete this exercise, I am going to need a program that can calculate the area of a regular polygon {rounded to 5 decimal places}
	polygon will be an n-sided shape that all sides are the same length and all angles are the same degree
		formula to figure this out; Area = n X (s^2) divided by (4 X tan(PI / n))
			s and n will be input by the user
				* Additionally, pow() and tan() should be seperately imported from the math module *

Analysis:

	Accomplishing this task will definitely require:
		The round() functiom for the 5 decimal requirement
		The print() function to display the area	
		The eval() and input() functions {most likely combined together for clean code}
		The aforementioned math module functions: pow(), and tan()

	formulas needed:
	    area = (n * (s^2)) / (4 * tan(pi / s))

	Possible errors:
		syntax due to frantic typing
		domain issues {I only need to worry about n though}

Design:

	I am going to begin by importing the functions from the math module using * from math import *.
	Next, I will use eval(input()) to prompt the user for the number of sides, and side length.
		I plan on using abs() for n to force a postive value from the user.
		"numberOfSides" will be used as the variable for n, and "sideLength" will be used for s.

	The variable "area" will be used for storing the result of the formula, during which the round function will be used.
	
	I will end the program by using the print function to display the area to the user.
	
	*Unnecessary role-playing flair may be added*

Implementation (see task1.py).

Testing:
	
	Test 1:
		input values: n = 7, and s = 7
		output: area = 178 {unexpected output}
			*I can see that I forgot to specifiy to how many decimals to round to, and so I went and fixed that*

	Test 2:
		input values: n = 8, and s = 12
		output: area = 695.29351
			*goood...gooood, this death star is fully operational!*

	Test 3:
		input values: n = 9, and s = 13
		output: area = 1044.72829

	Conclusion:
		Test went smoothly after specifying the decimal range to 5, ie:round(x, 5).
