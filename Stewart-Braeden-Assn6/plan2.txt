Assn-6: Task 1

	My goal with this program is to calculate and display the gross income, net income (after deductions).
	The user must be able to input the name, pay rate, and weekly hours of the employee for calculating the results.

	Additionally, The output must be formatted according to these standards:
		Headings of sections are centered and spaces between sections
		Main output header is all capitalized
		Output numbers are right aligned with decimals aligned
		Colons and $ signs are aligned
		A single print statement is used for output

	functions needed:
	    print()
	    format()
	    input()
	    eval()
	    abs()
	    str()

    formulas needed:


	Possible issue could be:
		user inputs a negative number {may force variables to be abs()}
		variables need to be converted to str() or int().

Design:
	I plan to start the program by importing the necessary functions
		*may or may not need math to be imported*
	
	The next step will be to use the eval(input()) function to prompt the user for these inputs:
		Employee's name = employeeName
		Number of hours worked in a week = weeklyHours
		hourly pay rate = payRate
		federal tax rate = federalTaxRate
		state tax rate = stateTaxRate

	After the input is given, the program will restate the employee's name with the hours worked and the pay rate
	Also, the Gross pay will be claculated { = grossPay}, and then displayed to the user
	
	The deductions will then display the total amount withheld = totalDeduction
		The individual amount for the state and federal withholding will be displayed as well
			federalWithholding and stateWithholding

	Finally, the net pay will be calculated from grossPay - totalDeduction = netPay, and then displayed

	To format everything, we assign them new variables
		ie finalOutput = format(output, "<alignment><sign>,<precision><type>")
	
	*NOTE: everything is displayed at the same time at the end with a single print function
		calculations will be done before*

Implementation: see task2.py

Testing:
	
	Test 1:
		Input:
		    Name = Han Solo
		    weekly hours = 25
		    hourly pay rate = 15
		    federal tax (or galactic tax) = .25
		    state (planetary) tax = .10

        Output:
             HAN SOLO PAY INFORMATION

                   pay
                          Hours Worked:            25
                              Pay Rate: $       15.00
                             Gross Pay: $      375.00

                Deductions
           Federal Withholding (25.0%): $       93.75
             State Withholding (10.0%): $       37.50
                       Total Deduction: $      131.25

                               Net Pay: $      243.75

        *Worked quite well, but looking back at the code, it was a little messy, so augmented operators should fix that*

    Test 2:
        Input:
            Name = Braeden Stewart
            weekly hours = 40
            hourly pay rate = 13
            federal tax = .15
            state tax = .07

        Output:
             BRAEDEN STEWART PAY INFORMATION

                  pay
                         Hours Worked:            40
                             Pay Rate: $       13.00
                            Gross Pay: $      520.00

               Deductions
          Federal Withholding (15.0%): $       78.00
             State Withholding (7.0%): $       36.40
                      Total Deduction: $      114.40

                              Net Pay: $      405.60

        *Success! Works perfectly and the code is a lot neater and organized!*

    Test 3:
        Input:
            Name = Crash Bandicoot
            weekly hours = 168
            hourly pay rate = 100
            federal tax = .50
            state tax = .50

        Output:
             CRASH BANDICOOT PAY INFORMATION

                  pay
                         Hours Worked:           168
                             Pay Rate: $      100.00
                            Gross Pay: $    16800.00

               Deductions
          Federal Withholding (50.0%): $     8400.00
            State Withholding (50.0%): $     8400.00
                      Total Deduction: $    16800.00

                              Net Pay: $        0.00

        *Another success! slightly more hilarious, but was needed to test the limits*
