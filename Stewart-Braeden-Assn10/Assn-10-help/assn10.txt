    My goal with this program is to draw circular patterns according to user input

Design:

    pattern.py will start by import turtle

    pattern.py will then define the setup() function to set the speed, and original orientation

    drawRectanglePattern() will be defined

        turtle will go to given coordinates and begin loop to draw all the rectangles in a circular pattern
