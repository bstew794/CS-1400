    My goal with this program is to draw circular patterns according to user input

Design:

    pattern.py will start by import turtle

    pattern.py will then define the setup() function to set the speed, and original orientation

    reset() will be defined to clear the turtle drawings

    setRandomColor() will be defined to select a random color for turtle

    drawRectangle() will be defined to draw a rectangle of width X height with a rotation

    drawCircle() will be defined to draw a circle

    drawRectanglePattern() will be defined:

        turtle will go to given coordinates and begin a loop to draw all the rectangles in a circular pattern

    drawCirclePattern() will be defined:

       turtle will go to given coordinates and begin a loop to draw all the circles in a circular pattern

    drawSuperPattern() will be defined:

        turtle will randomly draw a rectangle pattern or circle pattern with random positions and sizes

        turtle will end loop once number of patterns has been satisfied


    assn10.py will start by importing pattern.py

    main() will be defined:

        pattern will be set-up, and then prompt the user for which mode they want to play

        depending on user input, a circle, rectangle, or super pattern will be drawn

        the user will be prompted again for an input on whether they want to continue playing

        depending on user input, the window may be cleared, stay the same or be left open

        program will end if the user decides that they do not want to play anymore

    end of line...

Implementation: see assn10.py and pattern.py

Testing:

    Test 1:
        Input:

            1) Rectangle Pattern
            2) Circle Pattern
            3) Super Pattern
            Which mode do you want to play? 1, 2 or 3: 1

        Output:

            program asks for rectangle pattern values

    Test 2:
        Input:

            give me some center coordinates(x,y): 0,0
            Give me an offset value:50
            Give me a rectangle width:25
            Give me a rectangle height:75
            How many rectangles do you want it to have?10
            Give me a rotation value:45

        Output:

            program draws rectangle pattern using values given

    Test 3:
        Input:

            Do you want to play again?
            1) Yes, and keep drawings
            2) Yes, and clear drawings
            3) No, I am all done
            Choose 1, 2, or 3: 3

        Output:

            Thanks for playing!
