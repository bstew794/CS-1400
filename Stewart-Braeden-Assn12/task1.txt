Assn12 - Task 1

    My goal is to create a program that draws a chessboard according to user input of location, height, and width.
        I need to use classes this time to approach the problem in a Object-Orientated way.

        requirements include: not modifying the given "assn12-task1.py", and making sure all variables
        and functions are private except for draw().

Design:

    chessboard.py will import turtle

    the class Chessboard will be defined
        startX, startY, height, and width will be initialized here with default values of 250 for height and width

    drawBorder() will be defined as a private function
        it will draw the border of the chessboard at startX, startY with variables width and height

    drawRectangle() will be defined as a private function
        it will draw each individual black rectangle for the checkered pattern

    drawAllRectangles() will be defined as a private function
        a while loop will be created:
            this will end when it has gone through 8 iterations

            another while will be created:
                this will end when it has gone through 8 iterations
                this will draw the checkered pattern by calling drawRectangle till done

    draw() will be defined as a public function
        drawBorder() will be called
        drawAllRectangles() will be called


    assn12-task1.py will start by importing turtle

    assn12-task1.py will import Chessboard from chessboard.py

    main() will be defined
        it will ask for user input and draw the chessboard accordingly

    main() will be invoked

    end of line...

Implementation: see assn12-task1.py and chessboard.py

Testing:

    Test 1:
        Input:

            Enter a starting point: 0,0
            Input a width:
            Input a height:

        Output:

            A 250 X 250 chessboard is drawn with its bottom left corner at (0,0)

    Test 2:
        Input:

            Enter a starting point: 0,0
            Input a width: 100
            Input a height:

        Output:

            A 250 X 100 chessboard is drawn with its bottom left corner at (0,0)

    Test 3:
        Input:

            Enter a starting point: 0,0
            Input a width:
            Input a height: 100

        Output:

            A 100 X 250 chessboard is drawn with its bottom left corner at (0,0)

    Test 4:
        Input:

            Enter a starting point: 0,0
            Input a width: 100
            Input a height: 100

        Output:

            A 100 X 100 chessboard is drawn with its bottom left corner at (0,0)
