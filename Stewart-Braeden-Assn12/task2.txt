assn12 - task 2

    My hope for this program is to create a class called Password that will be used to analyze a user-given password
        against predetermined standards such as: password length, characters, and that it does not contain the string
        "password".

        The program must return an appropriate error message, and ask for a new password if isValid() returns False.

        The Password class must been in its own file named password.py, and the class must have
        isValid(), setPassword(), getErrorMessage() at minimum.

Design:

    the Password class will be defined:

        self.__password, and self.__Message will be initialized

        setPassword() will be defined to change self.__password when needed

        getErrorMessage() will be defined to return self.__message

        isValid() will be defined:

            it will check if "password" is contained in self.__password
                returns False if True

            then isValid() will check if self.__password ends with "123"
                returns False if True

            checks if password is shorter than 8 characters
                returns False if True

            checks if password does not have two digits in it
                returns False if True

            checks if password is not made of ONLY aplhanumeric characters
                returns False if True

            returns True if it does not meet any of these conditions


    the assn12-task2.py program starts by importing the Password class from password.py

    main() is defined:

        asks for a password from the user

        while loop starts

            tests password by calling isValid()

            if False:
                prints error message and asks for new password from user

            else:
                break the while loop

        print "Thank you"

    main() is evoked

    end of line...

Implementation: see assn12-task2.py and password.py

Testing:

    Test 1:
        Input:

            Please enter a new password:
            password123

        Output:

                   You may not use "password" as a password...

                    Please enter a new password:

    Test 2:
        Input:

            Please enter a new password:
            StarWars35!

        Output:

            Your password can only contain letters and digits.

            Please enter a new password:

    Test 3:
        Input:

            Please enter a new password:
            StarWars35

        Output:

            That is a valid password,

            Thank you for your time
