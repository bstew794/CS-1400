Assn-9

    My goal with this program is to draw a chessboard using the turtle module in python. Some additional requirements
        are that this must be done using functions that are defined in a separate file named chessboard.py.
        The main file, assn9.py must then import these functions to display the chessboard according to a
        location, width,and height provided by the user. If a width and height are not provided then the system
        will use a default value of 250 for both the width and height.

    First off, I will ned to import turtle at the top of chessboard.py, which will then allow me to define functions
        for drawing the checkered pattern, and the border.

    I will use while loops to repeatably draw small black rectangles to form a checkered pattern.

    Conditionals such as AND, ==, etc will be used to determine what course to take if the user did not input values
        for the width and height.

    possible issues could include:
        user inputs an invalid value
        assn9.py does not import chessboard.py easily
        syntax and logic errors on my part

Design:

    chessboard.py will begin by importing turtle

    chessboard.py will define a function that draws a simple black rectangle

    chessboard.py will define drawAllRectangles() as a function for creating the checkered pattern

        The size of each checkered square will be found by dividing the width, and height by 8

        The center of the first square will be found, and count will be assigned a starting value

        while loops will be created that draw the checkered squares row by row calling drawRectangle()

    drawChessboard() will be defined as a function that draws the entire chessboard

        The border will be drawn.

        Then drawAllRectangles() will be called to draw the checkered pattern.

    main() will be defined in chessboard.py as a function that determines which of four paths to go.

        The first path is determined by if width == "" AND height == ""

        The second path is determined by if width == ""

        The third path is determined by if height == ""

        The fourth path is when both width and height are provided by the user.


    assn9.py will begin by importing chessboard.py

    It will then ask the user to input values for location, width, and height

    assn9.py will call main() from chessboard.py to draw the chessboard to user specifications

    End of line...

Implementation: see assn9.py and chessboard.py

Testing:

    Test 1:
        input:

            Please give me an x-component:100
            Please give me an y-component:100
            Please give me the desired width:100
            Please give me the desire height:100

        output:

            A 100 X 100 chessboard is drawn at (100, 100), showing that it took the fourth path without issue.

    Test 2:
        input:

            Please give me an x-component:100
            Please give me an y-component:100
            Please give me the desired width:100
            Please give me the desire height:

        output:

            A 100 X 250 rectangular chessboard is drawn at (100, 100), showing that it took the third path excellently.

    Test 3:
        input:

            Please give me an x-component:100
            Please give me an y-component:100
            Please give me the desired width:
            Please give me the desire height:100

        output:

            A 250 X 100 rectangular chessboard is drawn at (100, 100), showing that it took the second path excellently.

    Test 4:
        input:

            Please give me an x-component:100
            Please give me an y-component:100
            Please give me the desired width:
            Please give me the desire height:

        output:

            A 250 X 250 chessboard is drawn at (100, 100), showing that it took the first path without issue.
