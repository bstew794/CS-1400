Assn11 - task 2

    My goal is to create a program that manages a user's bank account and displays information regarding this account.
     I hope to store the user's information using classes.

     Some requirements include: restricting user input to positive numbers, restricting annual interest rate to under
     ten percent, and that asks user to give a viable input.

Design:

    account.py will start by defining class "Account"
        id, balance, and annual interest rate will be initialized here as private variables

    getId, getBalance, and getAnnualInterestRate will be defined as public functions to retrieve the private variables

    getMonthlyInterestRate, and getMonthlyInterest will be defined as public functions to retrieve the their variables

    withdraw and deposit will be defined as functions


    assn11-task2.py will begin by importing account.py

    main() will be defined:

        a while loop will be used
            the user will be prompted to input an id, balance, and annualInterestRate value

            if annualInterestRate > 10 or if any of the variables are negative, then the loop will start over

        the Account class will be invoked to store the variables of id, balance, and annualInterestRate

        a while loop will be used
            a menu will be display showing 8 options for the user to choose from to do. the 8 options are Display ID,
            Display Balance, Display Annual Interest Rate, Display Monthly Interest Rate, Display Monthly Interest,
            Withdraw Money, Deposit Money, Exit

            if the user inputs a value outside of 1-8 then the loop will restart and ask the user for a valid input

        "Goodbye" is printed if the user chooses Exit, and the function ends

    main() is invoked

    end of line...

Implementation: see account.py, and assn11-task2.py

Testing:

    Test 1:
        Input:

            Please give me an ID, balance, and annual interest rate:
            1234,4321,5
            (1:) Display ID
            (2:) Display Balance
            (3:) Display Annual Interest Rate
            (4:) Display Monthly Interest Rate
            (5:) Display Monthly Interest
            (6:) Withdraw Money
            (7:) Deposit Money
            (8:) Exit

            What do you want to do?
            8

        Output:

            Goodbye!
    Test 2:
        Input:

            Please give me an ID, balance, and annual interest rate:
            -2,-2000,15

        Output:

            Negative numbers are not accepted, please try again.

            You cannot have an annual interest rate higher than 10, please try again.

            Please give me an ID, balance, and annual interest rate:

    Test 3:
        Input:

            Please give me an ID, balance, and annual interest rate:
            1234,4321,7
            (1:) Display ID
            (2:) Display Balance
            (3:) Display Annual Interest Rate
            (4:) Display Monthly Interest Rate
            (5:) Display Monthly Interest
            (6:) Withdraw Money
            (7:) Deposit Money
            (8:) Exit

            What do you want to do?
            9

        Output:

            I am sorry that is not a valid input

            (1:) Display ID
            (2:) Display Balance
            (3:) Display Annual Interest Rate
            (4:) Display Monthly Interest Rate
            (5:) Display Monthly Interest
            (6:) Withdraw Money
            (7:) Deposit Money
            (8:) Exit
